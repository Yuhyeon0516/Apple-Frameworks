<AppleFramework>
I've shown Apple's framework in a grid view.

<AppleFramework_DiffableDatasource>
The design previously composed of UICollectionViewDataSource & UICollectionViewFlowLayout has been changed to UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource & UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.

<AppleFramework_Modality>
In connection with Modality & Safari, it has been changed to display the framework information when the framework is touched.
